So, first day at new work at a climate research institute in Brazil. I'm a
computer engineer, so I know zero about climate modeling, but they gave me some
papers to read. And I don't understand a lot of terms.

A lot of people must have passed for this too, but did they document the
learning process? I don't have internet yet (hey, burocrats don't give you a
login at day one!), so I started writing this. I will try to document as much as
possible what I learn, hoping that others can find this useful.
